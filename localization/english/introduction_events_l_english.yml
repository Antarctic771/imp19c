 introduction_events.1.t:1 "The Mexican War of Independence"
 introduction_events.1.desc:1 "Five years ago, amidst the chaos of the Spanish war of independence, the fires of the Mexican independence wars were sparked by Miguel Hidalgo in Dolores, despite his execution, the revolt was able to organize and fight under the leadership of José María Morelos.\n\ \n\ Despite the attempts to organize a coherent government, the situation now is that the leadership of Morelos is all keeping the revolt coherent under the constant threat of the royalist army led by Agustín de Iturbide and the evil viceroy Calleja.\n\ If our great caudillo were to be killed or captured before he stabilizes the situation in the new nation, we would have to resort to guerrilla tactics under the leadership of Vicente Guerrero or Guadalupe Victoria.\n\ \n\ The time is ripe to give a final push and kick the spanish out of the Americas once and for all."

 introduction_events.2.t:0 "The Spanish Empire"
 introduction_events.2.desc:2 "The Spain of the Siglo de Oro and of the uncontested Bourboun Dynasty is no more.\n\ In 1815, Ferdinand VII has just been re-instated on the throne, and fully intends to undo the hard-fought-for Constitution of Càdiz that eliminated any distinction between the Spanish born in the Old World and the Spanish born in the colonies, gave limited rights to all citizens, and seemed to align itself to the ideals of the hated French Invaders.\n\ Reactionary forces clash with radical ones for the control of the country, and the colonies that used to be the lifeblood and the pride of the Spanish Crown have become a restless nightmare that saps many resources and threatens the standing of Spain, if not her very existence.\n\ \n\ There may be a dawn, at the end of this long night, but it definitely won't be reached easily."

 introduction_events.3.t:0 "The Congress Poland"
 introduction_events.3.desc:3 " The once great Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist a mere 20 years ago. The patriotic fervour, re-ignited by the Napoleon in recent years is still burning strong. Although the Duchy of Warsaw was just a French puppet, it gave the Polish people a hope for indenpendence.\n\ \n\  Now, under Russian rule, Poles have to decide whether they should follow their stubborn nature and try to break their chains by force, flooding the country with blood once again...  or whether they should stay docile and obedient to buy some long deserved peace...\n\ \n\  at least for now."

 introduction_events.4.desc:4 "It has been 182 years now since the nation of Japan closed its doors to the outside world, during this period of Sakoku(鎖国), our great nation has enjoyed a peace never before seen, all is well and the bakufu of the Tokugawa clan serves the best interests of the Crysanthenum throne.\n\ However, despite the harmony lived in our lands, the outside world has not stopped moving, and its gears are starting to make things move, however slowly. We stand at a crossroads, keep our way of life, or try to further understand the world, the artifacts brought by the dutch sailors are evermore advanced and sofisticated, perhaps the time is ripe.\n\ \n\ Will Japan be recognizable after this century? The Shogun Tokugawa Ienari and the Kokaku emperor might not see it now but things are slowly changing in our ever rigid society."

 introduction_events.6.a:0 "El Libertador will lead us to victory"
 introduction_events.7.t:0 "The Russian Empire"
 introduction_events.7.desc:0 "Russia's experience and history has been very different from that of all other European countries.\n\  Indeed, it is not strictly correct to call Russia European, the greater part of its vast lands lies in Asia. Situated as she is across two continents, and made up of over a hundred different national groups, each with their own culture and traditions, Russia is indeed a great continental empire. These disparate areas are held together by the all-powerful figure of the Tsar. Many Russians are still suspicious of any new-fangled ideas from the West and believe in the superiority of their own traditional view of the world. However, more critical, and often better educated, Russians are beginning to see their country as backward and out of step with the modern world but despair of doing anything about it.\n\  With his mental health deteriorating, the Tsar Alexander I is growing increasingly suspicious of those around him, more withdrawn, more religious, and more passive."
